# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Brain is an open project with the goal of growing into a community-driven language. Everyone who participates — through issues, pull requests, discussions, or any other channel — deserves a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience.

This is a space for people who love building things. We want it to stay that way.

## Our Standards

**We encourage:**

- Welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect for differing viewpoints, skill levels, and experience
- Constructive, specific feedback — criticize ideas, not people
- Patience and generosity, especially with those new to compilers or systems programming
- Honest, good-faith engagement

**We do not tolerate:**

- Harassment, intimidation, or personal attacks of any kind
- Discriminatory language or behavior related to age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or contributions
- Spamming, trolling, or sustained bad-faith behavior
- Publishing anyone's private information without their explicit consent

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces associated with the Brain project — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other forum where the project is represented.

---

## Enforcement

Brain is currently maintained by **Prince Gabrielle Jhon M. Libertad** ([@ASTRALLIBERTAD](https://github.com/ASTRALLIBERTAD)).

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by opening a GitHub issue tagged `[conduct]` or by reaching out to the maintainer directly via GitHub. All reports will be reviewed promptly and treated with discretion.

Anyone found to be in violation may be warned, have their contributions removed, or be blocked from the project depending on the severity of the behavior.

## A Note on This Project

Brain is being built in the open by one person with the hope of eventually building it with others. If you're here, it means you're interested in language design, compilers, or systems programming — and that's exciting. Treat this space and the people in it with care.
