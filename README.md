# Brain Programming Language

Brain is a programming language currently under active development, designed to be **type-safe**, **high-performance**, and **built for parallel programming**. It aims to combine low-level control with strong compile-time guarantees, making it suitable for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

> ⚠️ Brain is experimental. The language design, syntax, and compiler are still evolving and may change frequently.

---

## Goals

* 🔒 **Type Safety** – Strong static typing and compile-time checks to prevent common bugs
* ⚡ **High Performance** – Compiled to native code using LLVM for aggressive optimizations
* 🧵 **Parallel Programming** – Designed with safe and efficient parallel execution in mind
* 🛠️ **Low-level Control** – Suitable for systems, engines, and low-level software

---

## Features (Planned & In Progress)

* Static type system
* LLVM-based compiler backend
* Fast native code generation
* Ownership / safety checks at compile time
* Parallel and concurrent execution support
* Simple and predictable language semantics

---

## Project Status

Brain is in early development. Core components such as the lexer, parser, semantic analysis, and code generation are still being built. Documentation, tooling, and standard libraries are minimal or incomplete at this stage.

Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome as the language design matures.

---

## Use Cases

* Game engines
* Operating systems and low-level tools
* Performance-critical applications
* Learning and experimenting with language and compiler design
